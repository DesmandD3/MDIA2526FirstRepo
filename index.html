    <h2>Marvel Comics</h2>
    <p>Marvel was started in 1939 by Martin Goodman under a number of corporations and imprints but now known as 
        Timely Comics,[3] and by 1951 had generally become known as Atlas Comics. The Marvel era began in 1961, 
        the year that the company launched The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles created by Stan Lee, 
        Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and many others. The Marvel brand, which had been used over the years, was solidified 
        as the company's primary brand.</p>
